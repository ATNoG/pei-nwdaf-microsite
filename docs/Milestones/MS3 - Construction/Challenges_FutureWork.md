## Challenges


## Next Steps

Taking into account the work developed until this moment, the problems we will be focusing on in the future are the following:
- Enhancing **model parameterization**;
- Implementing **user authentication** and other privacy measures, following the RBAC principles, for a more secure access to the dashboard's information;
- Implementing the **data governance** component of our pipeline, responsible for ensuring specific policies over the received data, for example;
- Further implementing and improving the existing **Monitoring & Logging** system of the pipeline and respective components;
- Implementing the **Decision Making and Classification** component of the pipeline, responsible for receiving the generated inferences and deciding actual measures to apply to the affected network(s);
- Integrating the developed work within a real 5G network (**5G OAM**).

Besides this, further optimization will be done to the existing framework to improve performance and reliability.
