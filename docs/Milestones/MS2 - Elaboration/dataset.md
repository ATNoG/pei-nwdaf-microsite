We chose the **DoNext Dataset** ([GitLab Repository](https://gitlab.kn.e-technik.tu-dortmund.de/donext-the-dortmund-dataset/dortmund-dataset-public)), originally presented on the corresponding [IEEE page](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10976440). The dataset is thoroughly documented, including its intended use cases and the objectives of the development team.

Our decision was driven by the dataset’s **richness in both feature quantity and quality**, which aligns closely with the goals of our current project.

Among the study cases described in the dataset’s paper, we selected the one related to **Real-Time Data Rate & Latency Prediction**, as it is particularly well suited to our project’s focus.

The dataset includes several features that are highly relevant for this purpose, namely:

- RSRP & SS-RSRP - Reference Signal Received Power 
- RSRQ - Reference Signal Received Quality
- SINR - Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio
- Velocity
- ...
