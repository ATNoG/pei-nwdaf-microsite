- Maintenance of network
    - Manual maintenance and setup of a network is expensive and might be slow
    - According to [5G-Mobix](https://www.5g-mobix.com/assets/files/5G-MOBIX-D6.6-Final-report-on-the-business-models-for-cross-border-5G-deployment-enabling-CAM_v2.0.pdf) it might cost up to 13.800€ per year per station, if you need 100 stations to cover an urban area it adds up to 1.380.000€ per year
- Future networks will be so complex that manual maintenance would not be possible
- Reactive Aproach to network management
    - Manual maintenance might only react to a problem after it happens and then try to mitigate it, causing slowdowns and a drop of quality of the system

- SLA violations on Utilization Spikes
    - If not prepared well, the network might struggle to keep up with spikes in certains areas of the system, and cause drop of quality on those areas without the proper preparation and prediction of those spikes, those drops of quality will cause a violation on the requirements agreement to the quality of the network
