## Goals

- The primary goal of this system is to automatically and mainly without human intervention aquire data from the network and provide insights on the future load of the network
- The system aims to collect data from a 5G network using that network function, and with an architecture made to be scalable and focused on MLOps, will provide intelligence to the network in order for it to have its own intelligence, the different models will be trained and the system will automaticly switch troughout the models to ensure high performance of those models
- We also need to ensure that sensitive data about users is correctly processed and used in order not to invade their privacy

## Tasks

- **Log management**
- **Create APIâ€™s & UI**
- **Produce insights**
- **Data filtering**
- **Data storage**
- **Run a MLOps pipeline**
- **Continuous security & privacy assessment and enforcement**
- **Risk management**
