## Trust, Risk, and Security Management (AI TRiSM / RIGOROUS)

As ML and automation become central to network operations, ensuring trust, security, and risk governance across the pipeline becomes critical. The AI TRiSM (Artificial Intelligence Trust, Risk, and Security Management) framework addresses these challenges by embedding governance and security principles across the AI/ML lifecycle.

AI TRiSM encompasses four key pillars:

- **Trustworthiness and Explainability**: Models must provide transparent and interpretable outputs, enabling human operators to understand and validate ML-driven decisions.

- **Risk Management**: Identification, assessment, and mitigation of risks associated with data quality, model drift, adversarial manipulation, and operational failures.

- **Security and Compliance**: Implementation of robust access control, encryption, and audit mechanisms to protect data integrity and ensure regulatory compliance.

- **Governance and Accountability**: Establishing policies for model versioning, traceability, and decision logging to ensure operational and ethical accountability.

In this project, AI TRiSM principles are integrated throughout the MLOps pipeline and network interaction layers. Each stage - from data ingestion to model deployment - is accompanied by security validation, audit logging, and trust attestation. The system continuously monitors model integrity, detects anomalies in data flows, and enforces access policies through authentication and authorization mechanisms.

The adoption of TRiSM not only safeguards the system from data and model threats but also enhances transparency and confidence in AI-driven network decisions. It ensures that intelligent network operations remain robust, auditable, and ethically compliant, aligning with the vision of RIGOROUS AIâ€”Responsible, interpretable, governed, and observable intelligence systems.
