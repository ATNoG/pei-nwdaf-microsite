Our project, "Intelligence in Action: Achieving Trustworthy AI-Driven Networks," integrates machine learning (ML) and automation pipelines (MLOps) with 5G/6G networks, emphasizing trust, risk, and security management with dynamic network participation. We review key platforms and research. For each we assembled key features that may be relevant to our proejct.

### QMP: A Cloud-native MLOps Automation Platform for Zero-Touch Service Assurance in 5G Systems
[Link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9928678)

This platform implements an cloud-native MLOps automation platform for zero-touch service assurance in 5G networks, featuring a full pipeline ( data ingestion, storage, training, retraining and inference ).
It has a full pipeline that envolves data ingestion, store, training, retraining and inference.


### MLOps meets Edge Computing: an Edge Platform with Embedded Intelligence towards 6G Systems
[Link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10188244)

This platform implements a distributed automation platform for motorization and automatic control of "6G" networks.
User equipment would provide data for the system and data data would be use in the MLOps pipe to detect anomalies and predict performance in order to balance the network.
Focused more on streaming, using the Platform to Manage Edge Cache (a mini CDN close to users) to scale those caches automatically.
